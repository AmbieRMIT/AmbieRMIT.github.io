          The year is 1974 - Queen Elizabeth has sat on the throne for 22 years,
          Chinese farmers have just discovered 8,000 terracotta clay warrior statues and Rumble in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman is fought in Zaire, Africa.
          The same year 22 year old George Craig boards a plane from Glasgow, Scotland to Dunedin, New Zealand.
          He’s moving to the land of the long white cloud to chase a small white ball and life will never never look the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the 48 hour straight journey, George landed in New Zealand.  He’d survived a stopover in Singapore which could have resulted in him being taken off the plane and having his long hair forcibly cut.

      <blockquote>
        I was pretty fatigued when I arrived but within a few days, was at soccer training.  The first game we played was in 30 degree heat which I’d never experienced before let alone played soccer in!  I got a write up in the paper by the local soccer journalist saying my legs looked transparent they were so white and that I looked pale blue!

          But in this first match playing with this new soccer team, Caversham A.F.C, George was injured and substituted out of the game.  This was to make the next six weeks in New Zealand incredibly difficult <blockquote>“I got injured and then I couldn’t get back into the team because I lost form.  I was feeling very homesick.  I was really missing my girlfriend and family.”</blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
          The name Dunedin derives from Dun Eideann, the Scottish-Gaelic for Edinburgh.  However, George struggled to find further similarities with the United Kingdom.  Having weeks to try and recover from his injury, he thought <blockquote>“What have I done here?  The airport was just a landing strip, the terminal was a shed, my luggage was hand pulled off the plane, there was one channel, black and white and it went off at 9.30pm on a Sunday night.  I’d seen the show they were playing years beforehand.  It was like the back of beyond.  I thought ‘what the fuck have I done?’  I got pretty close to leaving.”</blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
          A quiet word in the ear of the teams coach, Alan Wright by his friend, Jimmy Wilson, who’d also moved over from Scotland, explained George's’ struggles.  <blockquote>“The coach said he’d put me in one more game.  Then I started scoring goals.” </blockquote>  Wearing the number 9 in the red and white Caversham strip, the Centre Forward scored goals <blockquote>“A total of four in that first game back.” </blockquote>  Impressing his new coach, he’d secured a spot back in the team.  <blockquote>“We won the league that year.  We won the Southern League first and then won our way via playoffs into the Rothmans National League.  We became a very successful team.”</blockquote>

          After the initial feelings in those first few weeks, George took to life in New Zealand.  He moved into a homestay with widower, Loris Harris, he was making friends with the team and he got a job as a TV technician carrying over from his job in Scotland.  It paid the princely sum of $120 a week and came with a car and petrol.  He was also earning $10 a week playing soccer.

          George settled into life in New Zealand.  It wasn’t long however before fate stepped in and life took a new turn.  Mrs Harris cleaned the house of Mrs Heward - mother of Ceidrik who was a cameraman who’d just come back from London filming with BBC.

          Ceidrik had mentioned needing someone to record sound for him.  Knowing George was good with technology, the two were introduced and <blockquote>“He offered me a job instantly, shooting the next day for the New Zealand Life Saving Society” </blockquote>  George was given the manual for the audio recorder Ceidrik wanted him to record sound on which he stayed up reading the whole night.  <blockquote>“I had a sleepless night.  This was a hugely complex machine.  I had never seen anything like it in my life.  They were recording feature films and dramas on it but I somehow managed to get it working with the microphone and we shot the next day.” </blockquote>

          The day was an enormous success.  The film was sold to 20 countries around the world and  Ceidrik and George set up a business together called Ciscon Films International.  <blockquote>“That was us off and running.  We used to have to go away a lot to shoot films because not many were shot around Dunedin so I started missing my regular soccer training.” </blockquote> George travelled the country shooting a range of different clips and commercials however, Wellington was where the action was.  <blockquote>“So that’s where we went.” </blockquote>

          Caversham were happy to fly their star striker down every weekend however <blockquote>“My fitness and training started to suffer.” </blockquote> Once a new coach came to the club, he said <blockquote>“those who wanted to play with the team, had to train with the team.  Being in Wellington, that was the end of me playing soccer for Caversham.” </blockquote> The South Island team who’d so dramatically changed his life, now fell away from it.  <blockquote>“I just wanted to pursue a job in the film industry.  I saw soccer as a secondary pastime.” </blockquote>

          As his soccer career fell away into the background, George’s film industry life took off.  Ceidrik and him became one of the first Stringer Crew’s in New Zealand - a two man cameraman and soundman crew who always work together.  They worked with some of the most popular celebrities and well known people of the day such as John Clark and the Prime Ministers of New Zealand.  They were flown around the country to film a variety of documentaries, TV series, commercials, TV pilots and news segments.  Eventually, they were commissioned to go to Montreal to shoot a documentary about the Olympic Games site which was being prepared for the 1976 games.
        </p>

        <p>
          From there, they flew to London where they set themselves up shooting film clips and sending them back to New Zealand for popular music show, The Grunt Machine.  During this time, they met people like Richard Branson who they spent a day with filming his newly signed band, Super Charge.  They were then asked to Sir Branson’s new manor to film emerging artist, Mike Oldfield who was recording a new album called Tubular Bells.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whilst living in London, George regularly drove up to his hometown of Glasgow to visit friends and family.  On Christmas Eve, 1975 he was set up on a blind date with a cute redhead who was a friend of a friend.  Veronica stole his heart and the two began dating.  New Zealand however, called their film crew back and in the new year of 1976, George and Ceidrik flew back to Wellington.  Veronica was to join George six months later.  But she couldn’t wait.  Within four weeks of George hitting New Zealand shores, Vickie turned up at his doorstep unable to wait.

        <p>
          The two started to build a new life together in Wellington.  Although George loved New Zealand, he craved something new.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “I wanted to change my life and start a new life in Australia.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Playing soccer for Wellington Waterside, he was offered a new contract with Melbourne Jewish team, Hakoah.  Seeing this as the next big opportunity to change his life, he arrived in Melbourne 8 August 1977 and began playing with his new team.  Soccer had once again, pulled George from one country to another.
        </p>

        <p>
          But George only managed to play one season with Hakoah.  He and the coach did not see eye to eye and when Keilor Austria knocked on his door and offered $1500 to sign on with them, a large amount of money for the 1970’s, he jumped at the chance.  He also began working as a sound recordist at the Head Office of the ABC in Gordon Street, Elsternwick.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life for George in Australia was amazing. The opportunities it offered were boundless. <blockquote>“I loved it.  I loved New Zealand too. But I had outgrown it so Australia was the new, big frontier - wide open spaces, beaches, beautiful women, good weed.  It was all here and hard not to love, especially after Glasgow.” </blockquote>

          Yet the game which had delivered him so many opportunities and changes in his life, again faded into the distance.  In 1980, his daughter, Amber was born and in 1981, Veronica and George separated and he began travelling the world recording sound.

          A few years passed before soccer came calling again, not quite ready to let George go.  <blockquote>“I started playing for Prahran Celtic after a few years of not playing soccer, and then a team called Altona City offered to buy me and I agreed.” </blockquote>  George was beginning to fall in love with the game all over again, appreciating it for the incredible opportunities it had brought him after it always being something of a secondary priority.

          <blockquote>We played in a first league game which was at Bell Park in Geelong but after that day, I never kicked a ball again in anger.” </blockquote> It was the game that took soccer away forever.  <blockquote>“I injured my knee, tearing all the ligaments and I’ve never played soccer again.” </blockquote>
